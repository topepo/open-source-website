RStudio addins are R functions that can be called through RStudio's interface. This package provides example addins and demonstrates how package authors can create and expose their own addins.

Addins are standard R functions with special registration metadata that RStudio automatically discovers from installed packages. The package includes working examples like insertInAddin (inserts `%in%` at cursor position) and findAndReplaceAddin (interactive code refactoring with Shiny), showing developers how to build both simple text insertion and interactive UI-based addins. Addins can be invoked through keyboard shortcuts and other RStudio UI gestures once registered.
