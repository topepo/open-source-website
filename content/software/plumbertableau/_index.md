plumbertableau enables R developers to create Analytics Extensions for Tableau workbooks using the Plumber API framework. These extensions allow Tableau users to call R functions in real time from calculated fields without writing R code themselves.

The package automatically handles Tableau's Analytics Extension protocol by generating required endpoints and routing requests to specific R functions defined by developers. This separation lets R developers build and publish extensions that Tableau users can call with simple syntax, and it integrates with RStudio Connect to host multiple extensions through a single endpoint while providing package management, security, and sandboxing features.
