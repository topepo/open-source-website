cpp11 is a header-only C++ library that enables R package developers to write C++ code that interacts with R objects. It provides a modern alternative to Rcpp with similar syntax for interfacing C++ with R.

The package offers several technical improvements including enforced copy-on-write semantics, safer R API usage, ALTREP support, and UTF-8 string handling throughout. It compiles faster with lower memory requirements than alternatives and avoids ABI compatibility issues by being completely header-only. The library can be vendored into packages to lock header versions and uses efficient data structures for memory protection and vector growth operations.
