The archive package provides R bindings to libarchive for working with compressed archives and files. It supports reading and writing many archive formats including tar, ZIP, 7-zip, RAR, and CAB, as well as various compression filters like gzip, bzip2, lzma, and xz.

The package offers connection-based interfaces that integrate seamlessly with base R and tidyverse functions like readr. It handles both single-file and multi-file archives, and can automatically detect compression formats when reading files. The package also supports layered compression and filtering, allowing you to combine multiple compression methods on a single file.
