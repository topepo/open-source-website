broom summarizes statistical model outputs into tidy tibbles, making model information easy to work with in R. It provides three main functions: `tidy()` extracts component-level information like regression coefficients, `glance()` returns model-level statistics like R-squared, and `augment()` adds observation-level data like fitted values and residuals to datasets.

The package supports over 100 models from popular R packages plus most base R statistical models. It solves the problem of inconsistent model output formats by converting them into consistent, rectangular data structures that work seamlessly with tidyverse tools for visualization and analysis. All augmented columns use a `.` prefix to avoid overwriting existing data.
