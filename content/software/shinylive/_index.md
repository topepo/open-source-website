Shinylive deploys Shiny applications that run entirely in the browser using Pyodide and webR, which are Python and R compiled to WebAssembly. This eliminates the need for a server to host Shiny apps.

The package handles building and bundling all necessary components to make Shiny applications work client-side in the browser. It manages package dependencies through a lockfile system, builds JavaScript resources from TypeScript sources, and creates a distribution that includes both the Shiny framework and additional Python/R packages beyond the base Pyodide installation. Developers can deploy Shiny apps that users can run without any backend infrastructure.
