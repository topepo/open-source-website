mirai is an async evaluation framework for R that enables parallel processing through background daemons (persistent worker processes). It provides a simple interface where `mirai()` evaluates expressions asynchronously and `daemons()` manages the worker pool.

The package uses a hub architecture where daemons connect to a host, allowing dynamic scaling from local machines to HPC clusters and cloud platforms. It features microsecond-level performance through NNG networking, supports custom serialization for torch tensors and Arrow/Polars data formats, and includes distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry. mirai serves as the parallel backend for major R packages including Shiny, purrr, tidymodels, and targets.
