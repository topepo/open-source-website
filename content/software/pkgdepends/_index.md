pkgdepends is a toolkit for resolving R package dependencies, downloading packages, and installing them. It's designed to be used as a building block within other R packages rather than as a standalone package manager.

The package includes a dependency solver that finds consistent package versions across your dependency tree. It supports multiple package sources including CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, GitLab, git repositories, and local files. All downloads and HTTP queries run concurrently, and package builds and installations happen in parallel for better performance.
