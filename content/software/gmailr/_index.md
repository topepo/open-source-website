gmailr exposes the Gmail API from R, allowing you to programmatically send, read, and manage Gmail messages and threads directly from R. It handles OAuth authentication and provides functions to compose emails from parts, send messages or drafts, and retrieve email data.

The package requires you to configure your own OAuth client for authentication, which gives you full control over API access and avoids shared credential limitations. It provides intuitive functions for building MIME messages piece by piece, creating drafts for review before sending, and accessing structured components of received emails like subject lines, bodies, and dates. This makes it useful for automated email workflows, monitoring inboxes, and integrating Gmail with R-based data pipelines.
