pkgbuild makes it easy to build R packages that contain compiled code. It provides tools to configure your R session, verify that build tools are installed correctly, and trigger automatic installation of build tools when using RStudio.

The package helps developers avoid common build problems by checking that compilation tools are properly configured before attempting to build. It can run code in an environment guaranteed to have build tools available, and it offers configuration options to optimize the build process for packages with large directories or special compilation requirements. The package also provides helpers to determine when package DLLs need recompilation based on source file changes.
