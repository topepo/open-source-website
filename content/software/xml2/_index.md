xml2 is an R package that provides bindings to the libxml2 library for working with HTML and XML documents. It offers a jQuery-inspired API for parsing, manipulating, and querying XML/HTML data structures in R.

The package handles memory management automatically, freeing XML documents when they're no longer referenced. It uses a simple class hierarchy with three main types (xml_node, xml_doc, xml_nodeset) and provides convenient namespace handling in XPath expressions. Operations on node sets are vectorized, applying functions across multiple nodes efficiently.
