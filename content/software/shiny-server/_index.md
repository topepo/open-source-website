Shiny Server is a server program that hosts Shiny applications and makes them accessible over the web. It allows you to deploy multiple Shiny apps, each with its own URL, on a Linux server.

The server can be configured to let any system user deploy their own applications, and it supports older browsers like IE9 that don't have websocket capabilities. It's free and open source under the AGPLv3 license, with pre-built installers available for Ubuntu and CentOS/RHEL distributions. The default configuration serves apps from a specified directory on port 3838, with full customization available through a configuration file.
