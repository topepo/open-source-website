This repository provides Docker images for RStudio's professional products: Workbench, Connect, and Package Manager. It includes both the main product images and supporting session images for running R content.

The images are designed as starting points that organizations should customize and rebuild to meet their security requirements. Key features include a hierarchical image structure with base images and product-specific layers, orchestrated builds using docker buildx bake, and validation testing with Goss. The repository uses a Justfile-based build system that allows building individual images or groups, with all dependency versions centrally defined in docker-bake.hcl for easy customization.
