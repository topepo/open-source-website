watcher provides R bindings to libfswatch for monitoring file system changes. It watches files or directories recursively and executes callbacks when changes are detected, using asynchronous background monitoring that doesn't block the R session.

The package uses platform-specific, event-driven APIs (FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows, etc.) for optimal performance on each operating system. It integrates with the later package to execute callbacks when R is idle, making it compatible with interactive sessions and Shiny applications. You can configure it to log changes or run custom R functions in response to file system events.
