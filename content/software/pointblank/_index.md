Pointblank is a Python data validation toolkit that assesses and monitors data quality across multiple backends including Polars, Pandas, DuckDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Parquet, PySpark, and Snowflake. It provides a chainable API for building validation pipelines that check data against business rules and generate interactive reports showing validation results.

The package emphasizes clear communication of data quality issues through customizable reports that make validation results immediately understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It includes AI-powered validation drafting that automatically suggests intelligent validation rules based on your data, threshold-based alerts with custom actions, YAML configuration support for version-controlled workflows, a CLI for running validations in CI/CD pipelines, and synthetic data generation for testing. Unlike validation libraries that only catch errors, Pointblank focuses on both finding issues and effectively sharing insights across teams.
