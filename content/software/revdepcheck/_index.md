revdepcheck runs R CMD check on all reverse dependencies of your package to identify if your changes break any dependent packages. It compares check results between the CRAN version and your development version, reporting only the differences.

The package addresses the false positive problem by running checks twice (once for each version) and uses crancache to speed up dependency installation. Checks run in parallel with a 10-minute timeout per package, and it can resume interrupted runs from where they left off. It generates summary reports showing which packages have new failures, helping you assess the downstream impact of your changes before releasing to CRAN.
