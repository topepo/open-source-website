tidyselect is a backend package that provides the column selection infrastructure used by dplyr, tidyr, and other tidyverse packages. It enables functions like `dplyr::select()` and `dplyr::pull()` to interpret flexible column selection expressions.

The package implements a consistent selection syntax across the tidyverse ecosystem, allowing users to select columns using bare names, ranges, helpers like `starts_with()`, and boolean operations. It's designed primarily for package developers who want to add tidyverse-style column selection to their own functions. The package handles the complex parsing and evaluation of selection expressions so that downstream packages don't need to implement this logic themselves.
