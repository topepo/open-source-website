The pingr package provides tools to check if remote computers and web servers are accessible. It supports ICMP ping, TCP port checking, DNS queries, and determining if your computer is online.

The package offers a portable alternative to system-specific network utilities, working consistently across platforms. It can measure roundtrip times for network diagnostics, query your public IP address, and perform flexible DNS lookups with more functionality than base R's nsl(). The TCP ping feature is particularly useful for checking if specific services are running on remote hosts without relying on ICMP, which is often blocked by firewalls.
