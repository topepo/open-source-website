xopen is a cross-platform R package that opens files, directories, or URLs using their associated system applications. It works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux, similar to R's `shell.exec()` but with better platform support.

The package handles platform differences automatically, removing the need to write OS-specific code for opening external resources. You can open items with their default applications or specify a particular application to use. It also supports passing command-line arguments to applications, making it useful for launching programs with specific configurations or parameters.
