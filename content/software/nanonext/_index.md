nanonext is a fast, lightweight R package for messaging, concurrency, and web communications built on NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) with a C implementation. It provides scalable networking protocols like pub/sub, request/reply, and push/pull patterns with support for multiple transports including TCP, IPC, WebSocket, and TLS.

The package enables non-blocking async I/O operations that resolve automatically, making it suitable for concurrent programming in R. It includes a unified web toolkit that handles HTTP, WebSocket, and streaming protocols on a single port with built-in TLS support. The cross-language compatibility allows R to exchange data with Python, C++, Go, and Rust applications using standard messaging protocols.
