Gert is a Git client for R that provides a simple interface to Git operations through R functions. It's built on libgit2 and designed for users who need programmatic Git access without leaving R.

Gert handles authentication automatically by integrating with your system's credential store and SSH agent, so it works with the same credentials as command-line Git. It uses standard R data types (vectors and data frames) for all inputs and outputs, making it straightforward to work with Git repositories programmatically. The package supports both HTTPS and SSH remotes, with built-in support for GitHub personal access tokens and SSH keys.
