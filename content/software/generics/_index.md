The generics package provides a collection of S3 generic methods that package developers can import and re-export instead of depending on heavier packages like broom. This reduces the number of dependencies needed to implement common methods like `tidy()`, `fit()`, or `explain()` for custom objects.

The package solves the dependency problem where developers previously had to import entire packages just to access a single generic method. It's lightweight and contains only generic function definitions, allowing packages to implement methods without pulling in unnecessary dependencies. For example, the recipes package uses generics to define `tidy()` methods without depending on broom.
