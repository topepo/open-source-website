covr is an R package that tracks test coverage for R packages and generates coverage reports. It can display results locally or upload them to services like Codecov or Coveralls.

The package works by modifying package code to add tracking calls, measuring coverage for both R and compiled code. It supports flexible exclusion of files, functions, or individual lines from coverage analysis using various methods including special comments, configuration files, and function arguments. covr integrates with any R testing framework and includes an RStudio addin for convenient access during development.
