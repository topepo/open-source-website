btw is a toolkit for connecting R with Large Language Models (LLMs) across different workflows. It helps R users provide context about their environment—data structures, packages, and documentation—to AI assistants, whether pasting into ChatGPT, chatting in an IDE, or building LLM-powered applications.

The package offers three main capabilities: a `btw()` function that gathers R session context and copies it to your clipboard for external LLMs, an interactive chat interface (`btw_app()`) that runs directly in your IDE with access to your R environment, and tools for building custom LLM applications through integration with the ellmer package or the Model Context Protocol. It solves the problem of LLMs lacking context about your R session by providing flexible tools to share environment data, documentation, and files with AI assistants.
