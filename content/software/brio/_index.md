brio is an R package that provides basic file input/output functions with guaranteed UTF-8 encoding and explicit control over line endings. It offers simple, reliable functions for reading and writing text files.

The package solves encoding inconsistencies by always using UTF-8, unlike base R functions which depend on system locale. It provides faster file reading than base R (roughly 4x faster) through larger block sizes and fewer memory copies. brio includes drop-in replacements for `base::readLines()` and `base::writeLines()` that allow straightforward package migration.
