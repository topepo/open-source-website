parsnip provides a unified interface for defining and fitting machine learning models in R. It allows you to specify models using a consistent syntax regardless of which underlying package (engine) you use to actually fit the model.

Different R packages that implement the same algorithm often have inconsistent argument names and interfaces. parsnip solves this by standardizing model specifications and separating the model definition from the computational engine, so you can switch between implementations (like ranger, randomForest, or Spark) without rewriting your code. It harmonizes argument names across packages and model types, making it easier to experiment with different algorithms and engines.
