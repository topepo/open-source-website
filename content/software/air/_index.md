Air is an R code formatter and language server implementation written in Rust. It provides both command-line formatting tools and language server protocol support for code editors.

Air offers a fast, modern alternative to existing R formatting tools by leveraging Rust's performance and the Biome project's language-agnostic tooling infrastructure. It implements the tidyverse style guide and integrates with popular code editors through LSP support. The Rust implementation provides significant speed improvements over R-based formatters while maintaining compatibility with established R code style conventions.
