This repository defines system-level dependencies required by R packages when deploying to shinyapps.io. When your Shiny application uses an R package that needs external libraries or software (beyond R itself), this repository ensures those dependencies are automatically installed on the hosting server.

The repository solves the problem of R packages failing at runtime due to missing system libraries. It provides a centralized, tested mapping between R packages and their required system dependencies. Contributors can add support for additional packages by opening issues or submitting pull requests following the contribution guidelines.
