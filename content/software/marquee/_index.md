Marquee is a markdown parser and renderer designed specifically for R's graphics engine, allowing you to render rich text formatted as markdown inside R graphics like ggplot2 or grid-based visualizations. The core function `marquee_grob()` creates a grid graphical object (grob) from markdown text that can be styled and drawn.

The package fully supports the CommonMark specification and uses a powerful textshaping backend to render text with customizable fonts, colors, and backgrounds. Unlike similar tools that parse HTML, marquee focuses exclusively on markdown syntax, making it a cleaner option for developers who want markdown-native text rendering in R graphics. It provides a straightforward way to add formatted documentation, labels, or annotations directly into plots without dealing with HTML or CSS complexity.
