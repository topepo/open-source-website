The `config` package manages environment-specific configuration values in R using YAML files. It allows you to define different settings for development, testing, and production environments and switch between them programmatically.

The package uses a simple YAML file structure with named configurations like "default" and "production" that contain key-value pairs. You access configuration values by calling `config::get()` to retrieve either the entire configuration list or specific values. The package supports inheritance between configurations and R expressions in config files, making it practical for deploying code across different environments without hardcoding values.
