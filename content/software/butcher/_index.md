butcher reduces the memory footprint of fitted model objects in R by removing unnecessary components that often bloat models due to formula usage, captured environments, and non-selective object construction. The package preserves prediction functionality while stripping away redundant parts that aren't needed for post-fit estimation.

The package provides `weigh()` and `locate()` functions to identify memory-heavy components, plus five axe methods (`axe_call()`, `axe_ctrl()`, `axe_data()`, `axe_env()`, `axe_fitted()`) to selectively remove specific parts of model objects. A convenience function `butcher()` executes all axing operations at once. This is particularly valuable when deploying models to production or storing many fitted models, where a model that should be 22 KB might otherwise consume 8 MB due to captured environments and unnecessary data.
