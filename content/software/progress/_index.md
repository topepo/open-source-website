The progress package provides ASCII progress bars for R terminal sessions. It uses an R6 class interface to create and update progress bars during long-running computations or downloads.

The package offers customizable display formats including elapsed time, estimated time to completion, download rates, and custom tokens. It works with both traditional for loops and functional programming approaches using purrr. The package includes a C++ API for use in compiled code and provides plyr integration for progress tracking in data manipulation pipelines.
