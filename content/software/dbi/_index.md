DBI is a database interface package for R that provides a standardized front-end API for connecting to and working with database management systems. It defines a common set of methods that work across different databases through backend-specific packages like RPostgres, RMariaDB, RSQLite, and odbc.

The package solves the problem of database-specific code by providing a unified interface inspired by similar systems in other languages (Perl's DBI, Java's JDBC, Python's DB-API). It supports essential database operations including connections, query execution, result extraction, transaction management, and metadata retrieval. This means you can write R code that works with multiple database systems by only changing the backend driver, not your application logic.
