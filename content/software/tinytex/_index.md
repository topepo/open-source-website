TinyTeX is a lightweight LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that starts small but automatically installs missing packages as needed. It solves the common problem where basic LaTeX installations are too minimal to work while full installations waste gigabytes on packages you'll never use.

The package handles LaTeX package management automatically, particularly for R Markdown users who won't need to manually install missing `.sty` files or learn complex `tlmgr` commands. This repo includes both the TinyTeX installation scripts and an R companion package that integrates LaTeX compilation into R workflows. The automatic package installation means you can focus on document creation rather than LaTeX distribution maintenance.
