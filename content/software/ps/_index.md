The ps package provides an API for querying and manipulating system processes in R. It allows you to list all running processes, get detailed information about specific processes, and perform operations like suspending, resuming, or terminating them.

The package handles process identification safely by tracking both process IDs and creation times to avoid issues with PID reuse. It works across Windows, macOS, and Linux and provides robust handling of finished and zombie processes. The implementation is based on the Python psutil library and includes functions for accessing process attributes like memory usage, CPU time, open files, environment variables, and parent-child relationships.
