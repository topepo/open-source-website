The backports package provides implementations of functions and function arguments that were introduced in newer versions of base R, allowing package developers to use modern R features while maintaining compatibility with older R installations. When a package imports backports, R automatically uses the native version if available or falls back to the backported implementation for older R versions.

This package is particularly valuable for maintaining backward compatibility without writing conditional code or sacrificing access to useful new functions. It includes backports for dozens of base R functions introduced from version 3.2.0 through 4.3.0, such as `dir.exists()`, `startsWith()`, `isFALSE()`, and `deparse1()`. Package developers can import all backports or selectively import only the specific functions they need, making it easy to support users running older R versions without duplicating implementation code.
