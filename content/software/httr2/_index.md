httr2 is a comprehensive HTTP client for R that provides a modern, pipeable API for working with web APIs. It allows you to create and modify request objects before executing them with `req_perform()`, replacing the need for separate `GET()`, `POST()`, and `DELETE()` functions.

The package includes built-in rate limiting and automatic retry capabilities for handling transient errors and API rate limits. It provides comprehensive OAuth support with customizable flows, automatic caching for cacheable responses, and tools for managing secrets and credentials securely. HTTP errors are automatically converted to R errors, and the package builds on curl to deliver robust functionality for API interactions.
