RPostgres is a DBI-compliant R interface for connecting to and querying PostgreSQL databases. It provides a modern implementation built with C++ that allows R users to interact with PostgreSQL through standard DBI methods.

The package offers several technical advantages including full support for parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, automatic cleanup of connections and result sets to prevent memory leaks, and performance improvements that reduce query overhead by approximately 5ms compared to the older RPostgreSQL package. It relies on the system libpq library for a simplified build process and provides complete DBI compatibility for standard database operations like reading, writing, and querying data.
