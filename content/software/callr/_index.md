callr is an R package that executes R functions in separate R processes, isolating computations from the current R session. It enables both synchronous and asynchronous process execution without affecting the parent process.

The package handles argument passing and return value copying between processes seamlessly, including error objects with full stack traces. It supports one-off function calls, persistent R sessions for repeated computations, and background processes that can be managed concurrently using polling. callr also provides interfaces for running R CMD commands and R scripts, with options to capture or redirect standard output and error streams.
