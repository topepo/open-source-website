The odbc package provides a DBI-compliant interface to ODBC drivers, allowing R users to connect to databases like SQL Server, Oracle, Databricks, and Snowflake.

This package offers a faster alternative to RODBC and RODBCDBI packages, built on the nanodbc C++ library for performance. It works seamlessly with DBI functions for common database operations (reading/writing tables, executing queries) and integrates with dbplyr for automatic SQL generation from dplyr code. The package handles the communication between R and database driver managers, supporting both named data sources and direct driver connections.
