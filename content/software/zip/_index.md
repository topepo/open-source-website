The zip package provides cross-platform tools for creating, reading, and extracting ZIP archives in R. It offers a simple interface for common compression tasks without requiring external system dependencies.

This package solves the problem of ZIP file handling across different operating systems by using a pure R implementation with C code. It supports background processing for compression and decompression operations, allowing non-blocking archive operations. The package can append files to existing archives, list archive contents with metadata like permissions and timestamps, and recursively add directories.
