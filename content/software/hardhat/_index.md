hardhat is a developer-focused R package designed to simplify the creation of new modeling packages while promoting consistent standards for R modeling interfaces. It provides infrastructure for preprocessing data at both fit time and prediction time.

The package offers four main capabilities: consistent data preprocessing with `mold()` and `forge()` functions, input validation to ensure prediction data matches training data structure, utility functions for common modeling tasks like adding intercepts and standardizing outputs, and a stricter reimagining of base R's preprocessing functions. This standardization reduces the implementation burden on package developers and creates predictable interfaces that benefit end users.
