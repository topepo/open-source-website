This project converts the official R manuals from their original texinfo format into modern Quarto books. It restructures the documentation to be more web-friendly by splitting manuals into separate chapter pages and deploying them as a searchable website.

The conversion pipeline provides several readability improvements over the standard R documentation: syntax highlighting for code examples, sidebar footnotes for easier reference, enhanced search functionality, and a cleaner overall design. The tool automates the entire process from downloading source files from the R SVN repository to generating the final Quarto website, using a combination of makeinfo, pandoc with custom Lua filters, and R scripts for post-processing.
