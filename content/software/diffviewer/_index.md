diffviewer provides an HTML widget for visually comparing files in R. It wraps three JavaScript libraries to handle different file types: resemble.js for images, daff.js for data frames, and jsdiff for text files.

The package extracts common comparison UI functionality from shinytest and vdiffr, making it useful for testing and validation workflows. It provides a unified interface for visual diff operations across different data types. The widget displays differences in an interactive HTML format that's easy to inspect and understand.
