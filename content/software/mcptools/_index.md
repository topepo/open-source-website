mcptools implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in R, enabling bidirectional integration between R and MCP-enabled AI tools. It allows R to function as both an MCP server (letting AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and VS Code Copilot run R code in your active R sessions) and as an MCP client (connecting third-party MCP servers to R-based chat applications).

The package solves the problem of AI assistants being unable to access or interact with your live R sessions and data. When used as a server, it enables models to run R code directly in your working sessions to answer questions about your data and environment. When used as a client, it integrates external tools (like GitHub, Confluence, or Google Drive) into R chat applications through the ellmer package, providing additional context for AI-powered workflows.
