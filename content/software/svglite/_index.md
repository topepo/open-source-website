svglite is an R graphics device that generates clean, web-ready SVG output with text preserved as editable elements rather than converted to polygons.

The package produces significantly smaller files and renders faster than R's built-in svg() device, making it suitable for dynamic web applications. It supports advanced typography features through systemfonts integration, including font discovery, webfont embedding, OpenType features, and custom font registration. The output prioritizes editability, allowing users to open and modify the resulting SVG files in vector graphics editors like Inkscape or Illustrator.
