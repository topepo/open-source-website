The bit64 package provides an S3 class for working with 64-bit integers in R. This addresses R's lack of native support for 64-bit integer types, which is needed when working with large identifiers, timestamps, or data that exceeds the 32-bit integer range.

The package enables efficient storage and manipulation of integers that would otherwise require floating-point representation, which can lose precision for large values. It provides arithmetic operations, comparisons, and coercion methods specifically designed for 64-bit integers. This is particularly useful when interfacing with databases, working with large datasets, or handling Unix timestamps and other identifiers that require the full 64-bit integer range.
