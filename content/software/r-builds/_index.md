r-builds provides precompiled R binaries for multiple Linux distributions that can be installed side-by-side without conflicts. These binaries are built with minimal dependencies and installed to `/opt/R/${R_VERSION}`, allowing developers to run multiple R versions simultaneously on systems like Posit Workbench.

The binaries work consistently across different Linux distributions and support both x86_64 and arm64 architectures. They use OpenBLAS for performance and include patches for known security vulnerabilities in older R versions. The package includes automated builds for new R releases, quick installation scripts, and extensive testing on platforms used in production by Posit Cloud and shinyapps.io.
