hugodown is an R package that transforms RMarkdown (.Rmd) files into markdown (.md) files specifically for Hugo static websites. It handles the R-to-markdown conversion while leaving Hugo to handle markdown-to-HTML rendering.

The package solves workflow challenges by only re-running R code when explicitly requested through knitting, making it practical for long-running analyses and multi-contributor blogs. It pins local previews to specific Hugo versions to prevent version conflicts, provides out-of-the-box support for HTML widgets and syntax highlighting, and includes helper functions for starting Hugo servers and creating new posts. Unlike blogdown, it maintains a strict separation between R processing and Hugo site generation.
