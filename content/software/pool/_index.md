The pool package manages database connections automatically, eliminating the need to manually create and close connections in R applications. This is particularly useful in interactive contexts like Shiny apps where connection management can be complex.

Pool creates a reusable pool of database connections that automatically grows, shrinks, or maintains itself based on demand. It integrates seamlessly with DBI and dplyr, requiring minimal code changes—typically just replacing `DBI::dbConnect()` with `dbPool()` and adding `poolClose()` at the end. This solves the problem of connection lifecycle management in multi-user or long-running applications where creating new connections for each query would be inefficient or error-prone.
