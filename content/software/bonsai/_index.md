bonsai provides bindings for additional tree-based model engines for use with the parsnip package in the tidymodels ecosystem. It extends parsnip's modeling capabilities by adding support for popular gradient boosting and tree-based algorithms.

The package adds engines for LightGBM, CatBoost, partykit, and aorsf to parsnip's boost_tree, decision_tree, and rand_forest model specifications. This allows users to access these high-performance tree-based algorithms through parsnip's unified interface, supporting both regression and classification tasks. bonsai is the official CRAN successor to the treesnip package, consolidating community work into a maintained tidymodels extension.
