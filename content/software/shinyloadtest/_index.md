The `shinyloadtest` package, along with the `shinycannon` command-line tool, enables load testing of deployed Shiny applications to estimate how many concurrent users an application can support. It helps developers and administrators determine if their app can handle expected traffic levels.

Load testing with `shinyloadtest` identifies performance bottlenecks and guides infrastructure, configuration, or code improvements. The workflow involves recording a typical user session, replaying it in parallel to simulate multiple simultaneous users, and analyzing the results through automated reports. This approach provides concrete evidence that Shiny applications can scale to handle large numbers of users when properly configured.
