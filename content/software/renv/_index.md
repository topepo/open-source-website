renv helps you create reproducible environments for R projects by managing package dependencies. It ensures that each project has its own isolated library of packages with specific versions recorded in a lockfile.

renv solves the problem of projects breaking when packages are updated for other work by giving each project its own private package library. It makes projects portable across different computers and platforms by recording exact package versions in a lockfile that can be used to restore the same environment anywhere. The package uses a shared cache to make installing packages across multiple projects fast and efficient.
