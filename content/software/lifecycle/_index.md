lifecycle provides a set of tools and conventions to manage the life cycle of your exported R functions. It helps package developers communicate the status and stability of their functions to users.

The package defines clear stages for functions (experimental, stable, deprecated, superseded) and provides tools to both signal these states to users and handle lifecycle changes in dependencies. It establishes consistent conventions for evolving APIs over time, making it easier for developers to maintain packages and for users to understand which functions are safe to rely on. The package emerged from practices developed while maintaining the tidyverse.
