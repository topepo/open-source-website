The jose package provides R implementations of JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) standards for working with JSON Web Keys (JWK), JSON Web Signatures (JWS), and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It enables generating and verifying cryptographic signatures and encoding/decoding authentication tokens using industry-standard formats.

This package is valuable for integrating R applications with modern web authentication systems like OAuth 2.0, LetsEncrypt, and GitHub Apps. It supports multiple cryptographic algorithms including RSA, ECDSA, and HMAC for signing operations. The formats it implements are natively supported by browser WebCryptoAPI, making it useful for building R services that interoperate with web-based authentication workflows.
