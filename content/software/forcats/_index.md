forcats is an R package designed to simplify working with factors, which are R's way of handling categorical variables with fixed sets of possible values. It provides tools for common factor manipulation tasks like reordering levels, changing values, and collapsing infrequent categories.

The package addresses the pain points of factor manipulation in R through functions that reorder factors by frequency (`fct_infreq()`), by another variable (`fct_reorder()`), manually (`fct_relevel()`), or collapse rare levels into an "other" category (`fct_lump()`). These tools are particularly useful for improving data visualization and analysis workflows. forcats is part of the tidyverse collection of packages and integrates seamlessly with other tidyverse tools.
