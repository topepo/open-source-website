pak is an R package installer that supports multiple sources including CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, git repositories, URLs, and local files. It serves as an alternative to `install.packages()` and `devtools::install_github()`.

pak offers three main advantages: speed through parallel downloads and caching, safety via dependency solving and system requirement management, and convenience by supporting packages from multiple sources in a single interface. It includes tools for visualizing dependency trees and explaining why specific dependencies are required, making it easier to understand and manage package installations.
