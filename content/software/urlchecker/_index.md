urlchecker validates URLs in R packages and automatically updates redirected links. It provides the same URL checking functionality that CRAN performs during package submission, but works with older R versions (pre-4.1).

The package uses concurrent requests to check URLs much faster than R's built-in tools package. It can detect broken links and automatically update 301 redirects to their new locations, saving manual work during package maintenance. This helps developers ensure their package documentation and URLs stay current before CRAN submission.
