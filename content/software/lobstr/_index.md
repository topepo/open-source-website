lobstr provides tools for inspecting the internal structure of R objects, going beyond what `str()` offers. It helps developers understand how R represents and stores data at a low level.

The package includes three main capabilities: visualizing abstract syntax trees of R expressions with `ast()`, examining object references and memory sharing with `ref()` and `obj_size()`, and displaying call stack relationships with `cst()`. These tools are particularly useful for understanding R's memory management, debugging complex data structures, and learning how R evaluates code. The package reveals internal details that are typically hidden from users.
