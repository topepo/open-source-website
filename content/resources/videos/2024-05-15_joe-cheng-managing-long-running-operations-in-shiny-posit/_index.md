description: 'It’s been years since Shiny evolved to allow asynchronous operations within applications, improving scalability. The introduction of the {promises} package enabled concurrent processing between multiple Shiny sessions, a significant step forward in handling background tasks. However, this did not address the need for intra-session concurrency, where users expect to interact with the application while long-running calculations are executed in the background.


  Recently, we added a new ExtendedTask feature to Shiny to allow for such intra-session concurrency. This new feature provides a different approach for developers to incorporate asynchronous tasks, enabling smoother user interactions during intensive computations. Alongside ExtendedTask, this talk will also discuss newer methods for launching asynchronous tasks, besides the usual {future} package. The focus will be on the practical application and integration of these features into Shiny applications.
