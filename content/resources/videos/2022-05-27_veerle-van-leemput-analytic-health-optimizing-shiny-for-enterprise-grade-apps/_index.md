  ⬢ pins: https://pins.rstudio.com/

  ⬢ plumber: https://www.rplumber.io/

  ⬢ blastula: https://github.com/rstudio/blastula

  ⬢ callR: https://github.com/r-lib/callr

  Timestamps:

  2:44 - Start of presentation

  5:41 - What qualifies as an enterprise-grade app?

  10:46 - UI first / user experience / prototyping

  13:20 - Separating code into separate scripts and creating code that''s easy to test

  17:15 - Golem

  19:28 - Functionize your code

  20:50 - Rhino package, framework for developing enterprise-grade apps at speed

  22:33 - Infrastructure, how do you bring this to your users? (lots of ways to do this. They do this with R, pins, plumber, rmd, blastula, and Posit Connect on Azure)

  31:17 - Optimizing Shiny (process configuration, cache, callR, API, feather)

  47:35 - Testing your app (shinyloadtest and shinycannon)

  50:23 - Testing for outcomes (shinytest2)

  52:15 - Monitor app performance & usage (blastula, shinycannon, usage metrics with Shiny app)


  Questions:

  57:38 - What''s the benefit of using pins rather than pulling the data from your database?

  59:30 - Are there package license considerations you had to think about when monetizing shiny applications?

  1:00:45 - Do you use promises to scale the application? (they use CallR)

  1:01:49 - For beginners, golem or rhino?

  1:02:50 - The myth is that only Python can be used for production apps, what made you choose to use R?

  1:05:12 - Is feather strictly better than using JSON?

  1:06:38 - Where do you see the line between BI (business intelligence) and Shiny for your applications?

  1:08:36 - Any tips for enterprise-grade UI development? Making beautiful apps (bs4Dash app)

  1:10:25 - Have you found an upper limit for users?

  1:12:19 - Any tips for more dynamic data? (optimizing database helps here)

  1:13:50 - Where do you install shinycannon? (on our development Linux server)

  1:15:00 - Can you share other resources or examples of code? (Slides here with resources: https://github.com/RStudioEnterpriseMeetup/Presentations/blob/main/VeerlevanLeemput-OptimizingShiny-20220525.pdf)
