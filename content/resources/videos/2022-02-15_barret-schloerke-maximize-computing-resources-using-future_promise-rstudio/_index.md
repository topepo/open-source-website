  In an ideal situation, the number of available future workers (future::nbrOfFreeWorkers()) is always more than the number of future::future() jobs. However, if a future job is attempted when the number of free workers is 0, then future will block the current R session until one becomes available.


  The advantage of using future_promise() over future::future() is that even if there aren’t future workers available, the future is scheduled to be done when workers become available via promises. In other words, future_promise() ensures the main R thread isn’t blocked when a future job is requested and can’t immediately perform the work (i.e., the number of jobs exceeds the number of workers).
